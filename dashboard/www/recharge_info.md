Groundwater recharge (also known as aquifer recharge) is the process of water moving from above the ground's surface through the ground until it reaches the underlying aquifer. Groundwater recharge can occur naturally, but it does not always keep up with the rate at which groundwater is pumped for human use. This is groundwater overdraft. Groundwater overdraft can cause undesirable results such as degradation of groundwater quality, land subsidence, and decreases in available water. 

<h2>Managed Aquifer Recharge</h2>
To mitigate the undesirable results of groundwater overdraft, efforts are being made to force the process of groundwater recharge. This is managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Types of MAR include infiltration ponds, agricultural groundwater banking, injection wells and levee removal. Both agricultural groundwater banking and levee removal are implemented within the South American Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory.

<h2>Agricultural Groundwater Banking MAR</h2>
Agricultural groundwater banking  (AGB) is the process of ponding water on crop lands during the off season with the intention to recharge the underlying aquifer system. This type of managed aquifer recharge is often convenient because agricultural areas are equipped with irrigation infrastructure. An AGB MAR project has been implemented in collaboration with the South American River Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory on the Kautz Vineyard properties. Dr. Laura Foglia is the lead on the project, she is working in collaboration with other scientists from UC Davis, UC Cooperative Extension, UC Santa Cruz and Sacramento State University to investigate the physical processes associated with AGB MAR. The project investigates the chemical and physical affects that MAR has on the groundwater system.

<h2>Levee Removal MAR</h2>
Levee removal MAR was implemented on the Cosumnes River at The Nature Conservancy's Oneto-Denier property near Galt, CA as a part of a levee-breach restoration project. Several sections of levee were strategically removed to reintroduce flooding. In addition to ecological benefits from floodplain reconnection, higher rates of aquifer recharge were observed. These aquifer recharge rates were observed after analyzing data from the South American Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory.
