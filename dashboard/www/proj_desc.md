The UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative is increasing data accessibility for people in control of California's groundwater management. To do this, UC Water Masters student Alysa Yoder and UC Water Director Dr. Graham Fogg have designed and implemented a groundwater observatory covering the South American River sub-basin. 

Motivation 
The South American River Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory is a response to observed groundwater data shortages in California, and the management challenges caused by these shortages. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) was passed in 2014. SGMA requires the constituents of California groundwater basins to form Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs). These GSAs will implement Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs) by 2020. Implementation of a successful GSP means that the basin will have a sustainable groundwater supply by 2040. However, groundwater level data is not always available at the quality needed to develop a successful GSP. 
Providing access to real time groundwater level data will give GSAs tools that will help them be successful, as they will be able to analyze groundwater level trends throughout time, and increase their understanding of the cause and effect relationships that characterize their basin. UC Davis' vision for this project includes its eventual expansion. It is our intention to pave the way for other agencies and GSAs themselves to implement their own real-time groundwater monitoring systems, which will strengthen California's groundwater data resources. 

Data Applications
Using data collected from the Groundwater Observatory, Yoder studies floodplain groundwater recharge at the Oneto-Denier field site, seeking to assess the impact of levee removal on floodplain groundwater recharge rates to determine potential results of future levee-removal restoration projects. 
Longterm groundwater level records are useful because they help landowners and groundwater managers understand long term trends that provide insights into how groundwater may behave under future conditions. Data can also be used for groundwater models that visualize groundwater availability under different scenarios. Data with greater spatial density allows more accurate determination of the water table and its fluctuations throughout space and time. 

Methods
The South American Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory is comprised of Solinst LevelSender telemetry systems. Water levels in each well are measured with a pressure transducer that communicates with the LevelSender through a direct read cable. The LevelSender unit contains batteries and a SIM card and transmits water level data to UC Davis where it is processed and automatically uploaded to this web dashboard. 
All of the wells in the South American Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory are provided for use by agencies like The Nature Conservancy and private landowners. We are extremely appreciative of the generosity provided by the agencies and individuals that have provided us with wells for the Observatory. Please contact us if you think your well would be a good candidate for the South American Sub-basin Groundwater Observatory.
