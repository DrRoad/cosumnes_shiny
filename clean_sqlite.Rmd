The purpose of this script is to take incoming SQLite data from level senders in the field, extract the emails, and gather information for each well, including:  

* battery life remaining  
* time  
* head  
* temperature  

Read in data (already extracted from SQLite db)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# read in data
#d <- read_csv('clean_me.csv')

# how many senders do we have?
d$SerialNumber %>% unique() # 0s correspond to notifications, and all others are actual level senders

senders <- d$SerialNumber %>% unique %>% .[-1] # remove the 0 serial number emails

# emails of interest are from these serial numbers, and have the word "Report" in their Subject Title
d %>% 
  filter(SerialNumber %in% senders) %>%
  filter(., grepl("Report", Subject)) %>% 
  select(Body) -> test

```


Work on extracting a table from the Body
```{r}
test %>% tidyr::separate(Body, as.character(seq(1:1000)), sep = "[\\r\\n]") %>% write_csv("test.csv")
getwd()
```
